All the scripts with no x permission are older ones for US Amazons?

If so:
* should copy-tickituat-to-tickituat and fetch_uat have the x bit removed?


~/db needs to exist before you can use these scrips

~/.ssh/sambauser and ~/.ssh/sambapass needs to exist so's you can copy files to the backup disk thingy
